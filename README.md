# Spectre Band

Welcome to the repository for the official website of Spectre, a fictional rock band. This project showcases an engaging
and essential website, leveraging contemporary web technologies, including HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript.
Primarily, this endeavor served as a personal hands-on training experience to sharpen my skills in HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript. Moreover, the project seamlessly integrates Vite.js, a robust build tool known for accelerating and
streamlining the development process of cutting-edge web projects.
